# Module-18-Challenge

In this repository you will find the Tableau Public workbook that contains all the necessary files for Module 18 Challenge. I was unable to load to Tableau Public server due to repeated errors but was able to upload the entire .twbx file to Github and ensured it opens and runs in Tableau Public.
